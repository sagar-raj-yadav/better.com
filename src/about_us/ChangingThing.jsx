          Homeownership is a huge part of our economy. Housing overall is a $33 trillion business, and mortgages account for $15 trillion. Yet home <br />
          finance operates in the same way it has for decades â€” through opaque systems and expensive intermediaries whose interests are <br />
          misaligned with consumers'.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.changingThingsApproach}>
          That's why Better.com is redefining the homeownership process from the ground up. We're using technology to make it faster and more <br />
          efficient, and humans to help make it friendly and enjoyable.
